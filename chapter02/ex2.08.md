Exercise 2.8
=======

At rush hour on a typical day, 25.0% of the cars approaching a fork in the street turn left and 75.0% turn high. On a particular day, 283 cars turned left and 752 turned right. Find the predicted uncertainty in these number and the probability that these measurements were not made on a "typical day"; that is, find the probability of obtaining a result that is as far or farther from the mean than the result measured on the particular day.

This exercise is similar to the Example 2.3 in page 22, in which the uncertainty is given by the standard deviation from:

**Given a single trial:**

Trial: 1

Left: 283

Right: 752

Total: 1035 (100%)

**The probabilities of Trial 1:**

Left: 0.2734

Right: 0.7266

**Predicted uncertainty:**
